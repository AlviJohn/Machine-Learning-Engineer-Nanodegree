    "This is the second Jupyter Notebook on OOP. Previously the main building blocks for OOP have been introduced. \n",
    "\n",
    "From here, the focus lies on an organisation in modules, i.e. Modularized Code. The main parts are therefore written in separate `.py` scripts. \n",

    "## Organizing into Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, a module is a single Python file that contains a collection of functions, classes, and or global variables.\n",
    "- A package is essentially a collection of modules places into a directory\n",
    "\n",
    "- [virtual machines in the cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/de/getting-started/tutorials/launch-a-virtual-machine/)\n",
    "- The Distribution and Gaussian code was refactored into individual modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Next:**\n",
    "Convert Distributions code into a Python package. A python package also needs an `__init__.py` file. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Create this __init__.py file and then pip install the package into your local Python installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to setup files so they can be pip installed?\n",
    "\n",
    "Folder structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "├── distributions\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a folder for your package, organised like in the shown folder structure above.\n",
    "- Create new subfolder with all the modules you want in your package, i.e. `distributions`\n",
    " - Folder needs to contain an `__init__.py` file. A package always needs an init file. \n",

    "\n",
    "- Go into a terminal and make sure you're in the directory with the `setup.py` file.\n",
    "- type: `pip install .`\n",

That way you if install your package on your computer, the package won't install into your main Python installation.
