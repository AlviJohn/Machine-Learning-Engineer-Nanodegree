    "After getting familiar with machine learning deployment we'll put these ideas to practice using [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) as one way to deploy machine learning models. \n",

    "\n",
    "- What is the machine learning workflow?\n",
    "- How does **deployment** fit into the machine learning workflow?\n",
    "- What is cloud computing?\n",
    "- Why are we using cloud computing for deploying machine learning models?\n",
    "- Why isn't deployment a part of many machine learning curriculums?\n",
    "- What does it mean for a model to be deployed?\n",

    "## Machine Learning Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Consists of three components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore & Process Data\n",
    " - Retrieve data\n",
    " - Clean & Explore: Explore patterns, remove any outliers\n",
    " - Transform and prepare: Data Normalization, train-validation-test split\n",
    "2.  Modeling\n",
    " - Develop & Train Model\n",
    " - Validate / Evaluate Model\n",
    "3. Deployment \n",
    " - Deploy to Production\n",
    " - Monitor and Update Model & Data \n",

    "Can be thought of as transforming an IT product into a service. \n",

    "> Using an internet connected device to log into a cloud computing service to access an IT resource. These IT resources are stored in the clud provider's data center. \n",

    "#### Why use cloud computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Opt to use cloud computing services due time and cost constraints of building own capacities (see capacity utilization graph below). The graph shows schematically how cloud computing compares to traditinoal infrastructure related to customer demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/curve3.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Building up or laying off infrastructure takes time and money, whereas cloud computing is easily scalable to the current demand. As it is assumed to very costly to have excess demand as well as it is costly to be capacity restricted it is economically reasonable to rely on cloud computing services. \n",
    "\n",
    "- AWS: [What is Cloud Computing?](https://aws.amazon.com/de/what-is-cloud-computing/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reduced investments and proportional costs (cost reduction)\n",
    "2. Increased scalability (providing simplified capacity planning)\n",
    "3. Increased availability and reliability (providing organizatinal agility)\n",
    "\n",
    "Risks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Potential) Increase in Security Vulnerabilities\n",
    "2. Reduced Operational Governance Control (over cloud resources)\n",
    "3. Limited Portability Between Cloud Providers\n",
