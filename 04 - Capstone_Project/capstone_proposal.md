## Proposal

### Domain Background

- Background information of the domain:
- Historical information relevant to the project should be included:
- Why this problem in the domain can or should be solved:  
- Academic research:
- Personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged:

Time Series Forecasting is a key challenge in business, economics, and many other areas. Having a marginal advantage in increasing forecast accuracy for future development of sales, demand, storage capacities, or many other target quantities may be of great benefit.

Unlike in many other areas of statistical applications, such as image classification or text analysis, deep learning did not take over in the realm of time series forecasting. Traditional methods, in particular the Autoregressive Integrated Moving-average (ARIMA) and exponential smoothing (ES) methods outperformed newly developed, more complex methods. It is not all that long ago that there was a widespread consensus that highly complex methods for time series forecasting were not performing better than traditional ones. Among others, Makridakis et al. (2018) noted that there is only limited scientific evidence that suggests that neural networks for time series forecasting are an essential tool for time series forecasting.

However, advances in deep learning for time series forecasting in the last two years seem to challenge this long lasting notion. In a highly regarded scientific competition, the M4 competition, a hybrid model that uses exponential smoothing and a recurrent neural network (RNN) showed the potential of RNN-based methods for time series forecasting and won the competition (Smyl, 2019, Makridakis et al., 2019).
